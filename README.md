# ArtificialSatellites-Taxonomie

In the context of the realization of a project of the threat intelligence module of the Master 2 SSI (information systems security) 2021-2022 in the UFR-MIM in Metz, we had the opportunity to contribute to the enrichment of MISP by focusing on a taxonomy dedicated to astronomy which is a domain that interests us particularly.
Given the diversity of this field, we focused on artificial satellites. 

# Implementation of the project 

After several extensive researches we found many interesting websites that helped us to build a large knowledge base on the different existing artificial satellites (about 1000).

# TO-DO LIST

- [x] Search for artificial satellites
- [X] Classification and sorting of information
- [X] Creating a proper json file in MISP format
- [ ] File verification
- [ ] Validation by the MISP team in charge of the project
- [ ] Integration into the MISP project
