# ArtificialSatellites-Taxonomie

In the context of the realization of a project of the threat intelligence module of the Master 2 SSI (information systems security) 2021-2022 in the UFR-MIM in Metz, we had the opportunity to contribute to the enrichment of MISP by focusing on a taxonomy dedicated to astronomy which is a domain that interests us particularly.
Given the diversity of this field, we focused on artificial satellites. 

# Implementation of the project
